## API Reference

The backend exposes the following RESTful endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                       | Description                               |
| :----- | :----------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/job-descriptions`     | Analyzes a JD from a URL and saves it.    |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/resumes/upload/batch` | Uploads and processes a batch of resumes. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/scores/batch-score`   | Scores a batch of resumes against a JD.   |

## Workflow Engine

<details>
<summary>Click to see a deep dive into the project's internal workflow</summary>

Let's break down the entire workflow of your project in greater detail, from the moment a user interacts with the interface to the final ranked results.

### Step 1: Frontend Interaction & State Management (in `frontend/app/page.tsx`)

When you land on the page, the React application initializes its state using `useState` hooks. This manages:

- **Inputs**: The job description URL (`jdUrl`) and the list of uploaded resume files (`files`).
- **UI State**: Loading indicators (`loading`), the current processing phase (`phase`), and status messages (`status`) to give you real-time feedback.
- **Scoring Weights**: The values for experience (`wExp`), skills (`wSk`), and trajectory (`wTr`) are controlled by sliders. A `useMemo` hook recalculates the normalized weights whenever you adjust a slider, ensuring they always add up to 100%.
- **Data**: The processed job description (`jdStruct`) and the final candidate results (`results`) are stored here once fetched from the backend.

### Step 2: Kicking Off the Process (`handleProcess` function)

When you click "Process Candidates," the `handleProcess` async function orchestrates the entire workflow by making a series of `fetch` calls to your FastAPI backend. It executes these steps in a specific order:

1.  **Analyze Job Description**: It makes a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/job-descriptions` with the URL you provided.
2.  **Upload Resumes**: It takes the list of files, bundles them into `FormData`, and sends them in a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/resumes/upload/batch`.
3.  **Score Candidates**: Once it receives the IDs for the processed job description and resumes, it makes a final `POST` request to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/scores/batch-score`. This request includes the IDs and the normalized scoring weights.

Throughout this process, it updates the `loading`, `phase`, and `status` states to show you exactly what's happening (e.g., "Analyzing JD...", "Uploading and processing 5 resume(s)...").

### Step 3: Backend Logic - The FastAPI Endpoints

This is where the core AI and data processing happens.

#### A. Job Description Endpoint (`job_descriptions.py`)

- Receives the URL from the frontend.
- Uses a library like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4` to fetch and parse the HTML content of the job page, extracting the main text.
- This text is then passed to a **Google Gemini** prompt, which is engineered to extract structured information like job title, required skills, years of experience, and key responsibilities.
- The structured JSON output from Gemini is saved as a new document in your **MongoDB** database. The unique ID of this document is returned to the frontend.

#### B. Resume Upload Endpoint (`resumes.py`)

- This endpoint is designed to handle multiple file uploads at once.
- It iterates through each uploaded file. Based on the file type (`.pdf`, `.docx`), it uses libraries like `pdfminer.six` or `python-docx` to extract the raw text.
- Similar to the job description, the raw text of each resume is sent to **Google Gemini** with a prompt designed to parse it into a structured format (e.g., name, skills, work history, education).
- Each parsed resume is stored as a document in MongoDB, and their new IDs are collected and returned to the frontend.

#### C. Scoring Endpoint (`scores.py`)

This is the most complex part of the backend.

- It receives the job description ID, a list of resume IDs, and the scoring weights.
- It fetches the corresponding structured data from MongoDB.
- **Experience Scoring**: It takes the work history sections from the job description and a resume. Using a **Sentence Transformer** model (like `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), it converts these texts into numerical vectors (embeddings). It then calculates the **cosine similarity** between these vectors to get a score from 0 to 1, representing how semantically similar the experiences are.
- **Skill Scoring**: It compares the list of required skills from the job description with the skills extracted from the resume and calculates an overlap score.
- **Trajectory Scoring**: It analyzes the progression of job titles and seniority levels in the resume to assess career growth, comparing it to the seniority level of the target job.
- **Final Calculation**: It combines these individual scores using the weights you provided from the frontend. For example: `Final Score = (exp_sim * wExp) + (skill_overlap * wSk) + (traj_score * wTr)`.
- The final, ranked list of candidates with their detailed score breakdowns is returned as a JSON array.

### Step 4: Visualizing Results and Reporting

- The frontend's `handleProcess` function receives the final JSON array and updates the `results` state using `setResults`.
- This state change automatically triggers a re-render in React:
  - The **Recharts** area chart is populated with the new data, creating a visual comparison of all candidates across the different scoring factors.
  - The "Ranked Candidates" section maps over the `results` array to display a detailed `Card` for each candidate, showing their overall score, a breakdown with progress bars, and extracted details like top skills.
- If you click **"Download Report,"** the `downloadPdfReport` function uses the `jsPDF` library to generate a PDF on the fly in your browser, creating a professional-looking table of the ranked candidates that you can save or share.

<summary>Scoring Engine Deep Dive (<code>scores.py</code>)</summary>

The scoring engine, defined in `backend/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/scores.py`, is the core of this platform. It calculates a candidate's suitability based on a multi-factor analysis. The main logic resides in the `POST /batch-score` endpoint.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of how it works:

1.  **Caching for Efficiency**

    - Before any computation, the engine creates a unique hash (`weights_hash`) based on the scoring weights provided by the user.
    - It checks the MongoDB `scores` collection for an existing document with the same `jd_id`, `resume_id`, and `weights_hash`.
    - If a match is found, the cached score is returned instantly, saving significant processing time and cost.

2.  **AI Content Detection**

    - For each new resume, the engine uses a specialized Google Gemini prompt (`AI_DETECT_PROMPT`) to estimate the likelihood that the resume text was generated by an LLM.
    - This returns an `ai_likelihood_percent`.
    - A `validity_pct` is then calculated using a non-linear formula (`100 - int((ai_pct ** 1.2) / (100 ** 0.2))`). This applies a more forgiving penalty to resumes with only moderate AI assistance, rather than penalizing them harshly.

3.  **Core Scoring Metrics**
    The final score is a weighted average of three key metrics:

    - **Experience Similarity (`exp_similarity`)**: This metric assesses how well a candidate's work experience aligns with the job responsibilities. Instead of using vector embeddings, it employs `rapidfuzz` library's text similarity algorithms (`token_set_ratio` and `partial_ratio`) on the raw text. This heuristic approach is fast and effective at capturing semantic overlap without the overhead of embedding models. The result is scaled using a square root function to boost mid-range scores.

    - **Skill Overlap (`skills_overlap_score`)**: This is a sophisticated fuzzy matching algorithm. For each skill required by the job description, it finds the _best possible match_ from the candidate's skills. This handles variations like "Python" vs. "Python 3" gracefully. The candidate's skills are sourced from both the parsed 'skills' section and skills mentioned within their 'experience bullets', providing a more holistic view. The final score is the average of these best-match scores.

    - **Trajectory Alignment (`trajectory_alignment`)**: This function quantifies career level alignment. It maps seniority levels (e.g., "Junior", "Senior", "Lead") to numerical values and scores the candidate based on the difference between their level and the job's required level. A perfect match scores 1.0, a one-level difference scores 0.8, and so on.

4.  **Final Score Calculation**

    - The three metrics are combined using the user-defined weights in the `candidate_score` function: `Final Score = (w_exp * exp_sim) + (w_skills * skill_overlap) + (w_traj * traj)`.
    - The result is normalized to a 0-100 scale.

5.  **Data Persistence**
    - The final score, along with its detailed breakdown and the `weights_hash`, is saved as a new document in the `scores` collection in MongoDB. This ensures that subsequent requests with the same parameters will hit the cache.
